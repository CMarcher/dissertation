The process systems engineering (PSE) field is critical to enabling detailed analysis and optimisation of industrial chemical processes. Despite this, modernisation of accessible optimisation software tools and techniques has slowed, with most software-based analysis performed via desktop applications constrained by the resource limits of local systems. More efficient optimisation techniques are available, but require software programming proficiency not held by the common process engineer. The cloud computing sector has significantly advanced the ability to run and deliver software in a distributed fashion, without requiring clients to procure and maintain physical hardware. Cloud-native software systems are better positioned to respond to dynamic usage and allocate computational resources efficiently based on need. There has been minimal convergence of the PSE and cloud computing fields.

This work details and evaluates the development of a cloud-native PSE software platform (the Ahuora Digital Platform) on a physical Kubernetes cluster, comparing the performance of the different software components running on the cluster versus a local deployment of said components.

% Is it worth stating some new research questions? I didn't actually create new research questions at the end of the literature review lol
