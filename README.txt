Latex is an Open Source tool for desktop publishing.  It relies on 
a markup language which you use to write your (source) document.  You then use
the Latex system to convert that source document into its finally form for
publishing, typically as a PDF document.

For a source document called 'sample-article.tex' a typically sequence
of commands to go through to produce a PDF where all citation references, 
as well as figure, table and equation numbers are resolved, is:

  pdflatex sample-article.tex
  bibtex sample-article.aux
  pdflatex sample-article.tex
  pdflatex sample-article.tex

This will generate the file 'sample-article.pdf' which can be viewed
with an appropriate PDF viewer, such as Acrobat, or 'evince' (Linux).

As you gain more experience with the document processing tool Latex, you 
will learn how and when you can run a more minimal sequence of commands.  
Look to the output these commands generate to see if any warnings appear about 
undefined labels. Such warnings are a sign that not all cross-references to citation,
figure, tables and the like have *not* been fully resolved in the produced PDF document.

For instance, if you have changed only text in the main body of your
report, then you should only need to run 1 instance of 'pdflatex'.  If
you have added or moved figures or tables around in the document, then you 
will likely need to run 'pdflatex' twice.  This is so the new cross-references 
generated by the first 'pdflatex' command can then be woven back into the report 
so -- where you have written something like, 'Shown in Figure~\ref{fig:myfig}' in 
the report -- the correct value for the label 'fig:myfig' is used.

If you have updated your bibliographic references (e.g., edited the 'references.bib'
file, given the file setup here), then you will need to run 'bibtex'
followed by 'pdflatex'; or quite possibly 'pdflatex', then 'bibtex',
then 'pdflatex' (again) if you updated your main report text to cite the new 
bibliographic reference just added to the .bib file.

If in any doubt, just stick with the above sequence of 4 commands in order.
While it might be overkill in some places, it typically gets the job done!

Maths Equations

Latex's ability to typeset mathematical equations is highly regarded, however
there is quite a bit to learn to use it.

Regardless of whether you are using Latex or not, when it comes to using mathematical 
notation in academic writing, the *type-setting* convention is for it to all flow as 
part of a single sentence, even if the maths equation itself on a newline and indented.  
This point is demonstrated, using Latex, in the following excerpt:

%%

The equation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sample}
\frac{\mathrm{d} z}{\mathrm{d} x}=z^2-4
\end{equation}
does \textbf{not} lead to
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d} z}{z^2}=-4\,\mathrm{d} x.
\]
In fact, Eqn.~\ref{eqn:sample yields
$\displaystyle{\frac{\mathrm{d} z}{z^2-4}=\mathrm{d} x}$.

Trouble Shooting

If you get an error, such as:

  Could not map source abbreviation for ptm

Chances are you are missing some fonts on the computer where you are running the 'pdflatex' command.

Short answer is, you'll likely need to install:
  texlive-fonts-recommended
